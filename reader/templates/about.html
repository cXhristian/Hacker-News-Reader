			<h1>Hacker News Reader</h1>
			<small>
				<em>Unofficial UI for news.ycombinator.com</em>
			</small>
		</div>
		<p>This project was started out of frustration from lack of proper mobile layout and other minor annoyances.
		The main goal of the project is to give a more user friendly interface that should work on every platform. Mobile support is especially important. </p>
		<p><strong>Current features:</strong>
		<em> Frontpage submissions and some simple sorting/filtering of those (new, top, Ask HN, etc.).
		</em> Full support for comments viewing including polls and Ask HN posts.
		<em> Can act as an API in reddit style (append .json to any page to get json output).
		</em> Responsive layout thanks to Bootstrap (with some tweaking).
		* Some comment enhancements like original posters name in a different color and comment collapsing. More planned. </p>
		<p>Written in Python 2.7 and uses the following:
		<em> Django
		</em> Bootstrap as a CSS framework
		<em> BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML
		</em> Sass/Compass for CSS
		<em> jQuery
		</em> PostgreSQL
		<em> Various timezone/time packages
		</em> Check <a href="https://github.com/cXhristian/Hacker-News-Reader/blob/master/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a> for a full list of Python packages</p>
		<p>Currently the project scrapes news.ycombinator.com directly which leads to some problems:
		<em> One major problem is being unable to scrape older comments too often
		* The "official" api HNSearch doesn't allow fetching by id rendering it completely useless for my use and most of the other unofficial apis have some problems with the formatting.
		</em> Semi-random banning of the scrape IP.
		* Normally I would just scrape with different IP addresses, but currently the project is hosted on AppFog free tier which only gives me one IP. I have a working port for Google App Engine, but for some reason it is unable to scrape HN at all. </p>
